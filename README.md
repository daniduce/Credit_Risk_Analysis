# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 

With the machine learning models we are using this to help solve the problem of credit risk and how it can be an unbalanced classification problem. We used a credit file from Lending Club that uses credit card data. The company wants to use a machine learning model in order to help better assess which candidates are loan worthy. We have used several different algorithms in order to reduce bias and find out which one is the best to help predict high or low risk loans.


## Results:

* Naive Random Oversampling
