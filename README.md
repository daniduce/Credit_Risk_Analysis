# Credit_Risk_Analysis

Overview of the analysis: 

With the machine learning models we are using this to help solve the problem of credit risk and how it can be an unbalanced classification problem. We used a credit file from LendingClub that uses credit card data. The company wants to use a machine learning model in order to help better assess which candidates are loan worthy. We have used several different algorithms in order to reduce bias and find out which one is the best to help predict high or low risk loans.






Results: Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

Summary: Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
